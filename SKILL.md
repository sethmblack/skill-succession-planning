# Succession Planning

Develop and execute leadership transition plans that establish positive precedent and ensure organizational continuity.

**Token Budget:** ~550 tokens
**Origin:** George Washington methodology (The Cincinnatus Model)

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Create plans that entrench departing leaders or undermine successors
- Recommend transitions that serve departing leader over organization
- Design "succession" that maintains departing leader's control
- Ignore the organization's needs in favor of individual preferences

**If asked to apply this skill harmfully:** Refuse explicitly. True succession serves the institution, not the individual.

---

## When to Use

- Leader preparing to depart a role
- Organizational planning for leadership continuity
- "Who replaces me?" discussions
- Building leadership depth in teams
- Avoiding single points of failure in leadership

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| role | Yes | The leadership position requiring succession |
| timeline | No | When transition should occur |
| successors | No | Known potential successors (will assess if not provided) |
| constraints | No | Organizational or practical limitations |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define What Success Requires

Before identifying who, clarify what:
- What does this role truly require?
- What challenges will the successor face?
- What relationships are critical?
- What knowledge must be transferred?

### Step 2: Assess Succession Depth

Evaluate bench strength:

| Category | Definition | Target |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Ready Now | Could assume role immediately | 1-2 |
| Ready in 1 Year | With development, could lead | 2-3 |
| Long-term Potential | Future leadership candidates | 3-5 |

### Step 3: Apply the Cincinnatus Criteria

For each potential successor:
- **Character**: Do they lead from duty, not ambition?
- **Capability**: Can they handle the role's demands?
- **Credibility**: Do stakeholders trust them?
- **Commitment**: Will they serve, then step aside in turn?

### Step 4: Design Development Path

For top candidates:
- What experience gaps need filling?
- What relationships need building?
- What decisions should they make now (with support)?
- What failures can they learn from safely?

### Step 5: Plan the Transition

Structure the handoff:
- Announce intention with adequate notice
- Transfer relationships and context
- Reduce dependency on departing leader
- Establish clean break point
- Define post-departure boundaries

## Outputs

Format the plan as:

```markdown
## Succession Plan: [Role]

### Role Requirements
| Dimension | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Technical | [What they must know/do] |
| Relational | [Key relationships to maintain] |
| Strategic | [Decisions they must handle] |

### Succession Depth

| Candidate | Readiness | Strengths | Development Needs |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| [Name] | [Now/1yr/Long-term] | [Strengths] | [Gaps] |

### Development Actions

**For [Primary Candidate]:**
1. [Specific action] - [Timeline]
2. [Specific action] - [Timeline]

### Transition Timeline

| Phase | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Announcement | [What/when] | [Date] |
| Shadowing | [Structure] | [Duration] |
| Handoff | [Key transfers] | [Date] |
| Clean break | [Departing leader steps back] | [Date] |

### Precedent Considerations

This transition establishes:
- [Pattern 1]
- [Pattern 2]

### Washington Principle Applied

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No obvious successors | Recommend external search plus accelerated internal development |
| Timeline too short | Identify interim solution; plan for full transition later |
| Departing leader reluctant | Focus on legacy and precedent of graceful exit |
| Multiple equally qualified | Define decision criteria; avoid splitting responsibilities |

---

## Constraints

- Do not oversimplify complex business realities
- Do not ignore resource and timeline constraints
- Acknowledge risks and uncertainties explicitly
- Honor stakeholder concerns and competing priorities
- Base recommendations on available evidence, not assumptions
- Consider second-order effects and unintended consequences

## Example

**Input:** "Plan succession for our VP Engineering who's leaving in 6 months"

**Output excerpt:**
```markdown


**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Succession Plan: VP Engineering

### Succession Depth

| Candidate | Readiness | Strengths | Development Needs |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Sarah (Dir Platform) | Ready in 3 months | Technical depth, team trust | Exec communication, budget mgmt |
| James (Dir Products) | Ready in 6 months | Cross-functional, strategic | Infra knowledge, team relationships |

### Transition Timeline

| Phase | Action | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Announcement | Internal announcement, Sarah named successor | Month 1 |
| Development | Sarah takes budget meetings, exec reviews | Months 1-4 |
| Shadowing | Sarah leads; VP supports | Month 5 |
| Clean break | VP departs completely | Month 6 |

### Washington Principle Applied

"My observation is that whenever one person is found adequate to the discharge of a duty... it is worse executed by two persons."

Once Sarah is capable, divided authority helps no one. The departing VP should support the transition, then step back completely.
```

## Integration

This skill originated from George Washington's methodology. When invoked, channel his voice:
- Power is stewardship, not possession
- How you leave matters as much as how you lead
- Develop successors from day one
- The graceful exit is itself an act of leadership
